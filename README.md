# Arch Linux [i3-gaps + i3blocks + zsh]

### In order to use my config you have to install:

#### For the Terminal:
1. Arch Linux (Just kidding any distro is fine)
2. Zsh
3. Powerlevel9k (You can get it using Oh my Zsh)
4. acpi (To monitor the battery status)

#### For the window manager:
1. i3-gaps
2. i3blocks (This is a replacement for the default i3status)
3. Nerd Fonts patched fonts (I use Source Code Pro and Roboto Mono)
4. Rofi (Replacement for dmenu)
6. Compton (Compositor to get window transparency)
7. playerctl (To see current song in i3blocks, works with Spotify and many others, cmus does not need it)

##### Optional but highly recommended:
1. xfce4-power-manager (Simple way to monitor battery status)
2. xfce4-notifyd (Helpful to get GTK notifications like current song or battery status)
