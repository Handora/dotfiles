# Arch Linux [i3-gaps + i3blocks + zsh + neofetch]

![Desktop](https://github.com/da-edra/dotfiles/blob/master/.desktop.png)

### In order to use my config you have to install:

#### For the Shell:
0. Arch Linux (Just kidding any distro is fine)
1. zsh
2. powerlevel9k (You can get it using Oh my Zsh)
3. acpi (To monitor the battery status)
4. neofetch (To display distribution logo and sys info)
5. catimg (Used to render images with neofetch)

#### For the window manager:
1. i3-gaps
2. i3blocks (This is a replacement for the default i3status)
3. Nerd Fonts patched fonts (I use Source Code Pro and Roboto Mono)
4. rofi (Replacement for dmenu)
6. compton (Compositor to get window transparency)
7. playerctl (Display current song in i3blocks)

##### Optional but highly recommended:
1. xfce4-power-manager (Simple way to monitor battery status)
2. xfce4-notifyd (Helpful to get GTK notifications like current song or battery status)
